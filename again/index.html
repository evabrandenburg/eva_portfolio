            <h1>ABOUT ME or HOW I GOT HERE</h1>
            <br>
            <h3>I AM EVA</h3>
             <p>A front-end web developer based in New York City.</p>
             <br>

            <h3>WHY</h3>
            <p>I got into front-end development after trying and failing to learn to code a few times. It was fun (and of course super hard) and challenging but as a life long artist I wanted to make stuff look cool not just do math. So I taught myself HTML and CSS (easier but way impressive, right?). I knew I needed to level up and finally learn to program so I took a front-end web development course at General Assembly. I improved my HTML and CSS a bunch and finally conquered my fear of coding and got into Javascript. I'm still learning (and hope to always be) and I've had a lot of fun along the way.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>I'M INTO A LOT OF THINGS</h3>
            <p>When I'm not photoshopping pictures of myself (gimping actually- that's what comes free with linux) I'm a social worker who works with the mentally ill. That's pretty awesome too. I do computer workshops at work but I'd love to combine both things more fully. People feel pretty awesome when they learn how to use their email but when you show someone how to alert "hello world" they totally freak! So if you're into combining those things let me know.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>IN MY FREE TIME</h3>
             <p>You can find me at various dive bars and cafes in the lower east side trying to look mysterious by typing frantically into the terminal (I'm probably just pushing to github. Got to keep my streak up.) Or an 8 year may have challeged me to a game of tennis in the park (he won). Either that or painting pictures of myself.</p>
             <br>
